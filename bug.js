This bug occurs when using the Expo `Camera` API with custom camera configurations. Specifically, when setting the `autoFocus` property to `'on'` and attempting to access the camera's preview before it is fully initialized, an error might occur, preventing the preview from displaying correctly.  The error is not always consistent, and can manifest in different ways depending on the device and Expo SDK version.
